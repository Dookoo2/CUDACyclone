# ‚ö°CUDACyclone: GPU Satoshi Puzzle Solver

Cyclone CUDA is the GPU-powered version of the **Cyclone** project, designed to achieve extreme performance in solving Satoshi puzzles on modern NVIDIA GPUs.  
Leveraging **CUDA**, **warp-level parallelism**, and **batch EC operations**, Cyclone CUDA pushes the limits of cryptographic key search.

Secp256k1 math is based on the excellent work from [JeanLucPons/VanitySearch](https://github.com/JeanLucPons/VanitySearch), with major CUDA-specific modifications.  
Special thanks to Jean-Luc Pons for his foundational contributions to the cryptographic community.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **GPU Acceleration**: Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs with full CUDA support.
- **Massive Parallelism**: Tens of thousands of threads computing elliptic curve points and **hash160** simultaneously.
- **Batch EC Operations**: Efficient group addition and modular inversion with warp-level optimizations.
- **Grid/Batch Control**: Fully configurable GPU execution with `--grid` parameter (threads per batch √ó points per batch).
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux and Windows (via WSL2 or MinGW cross-compilation).
- **Cross Architecture**: Automatic compilation for different architectures (75 86 89).
